# Note Taker Starter Code
The objective of this week's assignment was to modify the starter code of a note-taking application. The focus was on developing the backend using Express.js and integrating it with the existing front-end. Additionally, the application needed to be deployed to Heroku. The assignment required implementing several functionalities: creating a clickable link on the homepage to access the note-taking page, enabling users to enter a note title and text, and saving it so that it appears as a list on the left side of the page. The title and text fields should clear after saving to allow for new notes. Clicking on an existing note in the list should display its title and text in the main note field, while clicking the add note icon should clear the field for creating a new note. As a bonus task, the assignment included implementing a feature to delete notes by clicking on the garbage can icon next to each note in the list.
